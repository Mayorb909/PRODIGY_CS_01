# PRODIGY_CS_01
Creating a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. 

### OBJECTIVE
Creating a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. This will allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.


### SKILLS LEARNED
* Learnt the ACII Code algorithm.
* Master the use of some Python functions.
* Learnt how encryption algorithms work
  
### TOOLS USED

### STEPS
* I define the letter to encrypt in a variable
* I define the shift key for the ASCII Code
* I create a function to call the code again for other encryption operations
* I iterate through all the letters and convert them to capital letters
* I use the function "isalpha()" to exclude the space in the text from being encrypted
* I then use the function "ord" to perform the Ceacer cipher operation
